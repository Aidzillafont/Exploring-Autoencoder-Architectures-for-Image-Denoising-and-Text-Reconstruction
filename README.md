# Exploring Autoencoder Architectures for Image Denoising and Text Reconstruction

This repository explores various Autoencoder architectures for Image Denoising and Text Reconstruction tasks, comparing Dense and Convolutional models. The primary focus is on the impact of factors such as latent space size, layer depth, pooling, and regularization techniques on model performance.

## Repository Contents

1. `autoencoders.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing Dense and Convolutional Autoencoder implementations and results for Image Denoising and Text Reconstruction tasks.
2. `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in the `autoencoders.ipynb` notebook.

## Results

The results of this study demonstrate the importance of architecture choices for Autoencoder performance. For Image Denoising, deeper layers and larger latent spaces show better results, while for Text Reconstruction
